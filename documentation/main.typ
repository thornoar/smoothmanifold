= Introduction <sc-intro>

In higher mathematics, diagrams often take the form of "blobs" (representing sets and their subsets) placed on the plane, connected with paths or arrows. This is particularly true for set theory and topology, but other more advanced fields inherit this style. In differential geometry and multivariate calculus, one draws spheres, tori, and other surfaces in place of these "blobs". In category theory, commutative diagrams are commonplace, where the "blobs" are replaced by symbols. Here are a couple of examples, all drawn with `smoothmanifold`:

#[
  #show: it => columns(2, gutter: 0%, it)
  #figure(
    image("./resources/injection.svg"),
    caption: [An illustration of non-injectivity\ (set theory)]
  ) <injection>

  #figure(

  ) <tangent>
]
#v(-.5em)
#figure(
  image("./resources/baire-category-theorem.svg"),
  caption: [The proof of the Baire category theorem (topology)]
) <baire>

Take special note of the gaps that arrows leave on the boundaries of the ovals on @injection. I find this feature quite hard to achieve in plain Asymptote, and module `smoothmanifold` uses some dark magic to implement it. Similarly, note the shaded areas on @baire. They represent intersections of areas bounded by two paths. Finding the bounding path of such an intersection is non-trivial and also implemented in `smoothmanifold`. Lastly, @tangent shows a three-dimensional surface, while the picture was fully drawn in 2D. The illusion is achieved through these cross-sectional "rings" on the left of the diagram.\
To summarize, the most prominent features of module `smoothmanifold` are the following:

- *Gaps in overlapping paths*, achieved through a system of deferred drawing;
- *Set operations on paths bounding areas*, e.g. intersection, union, set difference, etc.;
- *Three-dimensional drawing*, achieved through an automatic (but configurable) addition of cross sections to smooth objects.

Do take a look at the #link("https://github.com/thornoar/smoothmanifold/tree/master/documentation/resources", [source code]) for the above diagrams, to get a feel for how much heavy lifting is done by the module, and what is required from the user. We will now consider each of the above mentioned features (and some others as well) in full detail.

= Deferred drawing and path overlapping <sc-def>

== The general mechanism <sc-def-general>

In the `picture` structure, the paths drawn on a picture are not stored in an array, but rather indirectly stored in a `void` callback. That is, when the `draw` function is called, the _instruction to draw_ the path is added to the picture, not the path itself. This makes it quite impossible to "modify the path after it is drawn". To go around this limitation, `smoothmanifold` introduces an auxiliary struct:
```
struct deferredPath {
    path[] g;
    pen p;
    int[] under;
    tarrow arrow;
    tbar bar;
}
``` <def-deferredPath>
It stores the path(s) to draw later, and how to draw them. Now, `smoothmanifold` executes the following steps to draw a "mutable" path `p` to a picture `pic` and then draw it for real:
+ Have a global two-dimensional array, say `arr`, of `deferredPath`'s;
+ Construct a `deferredPath` based on `p`, say `dp`;
+ Exploit the `nodes` field of the `picture` struct to store an integer. Retrieve this integer, say `n`, from `pic` (or create one if the `nodes` field doesn't contain it).
+ Store the deferred path `dp` in the one-dimensional array `arr[n]`;
+ Move on with the original code, perhaps modifying the deferred path `dp` in `arr` as needed, e.g. adding gaps;
+ At shipout time, when processing the picture `pic`, retrieve the index `n` from its `nodes` field and draw all `deferredPath` objects in the array `arr[n]`.
All these steps require no extra input from the user, since the shipout function is redefined to do them automatically. One only needs to use the `fitpath` function instead of `draw`.

== The `tarrow` and `tbar` structures <sc-def-tarrow-tbar>

Similarly to drawing paths to a picture, arrows and bars are implemented through a function type `bool(picture, path, pen, margin)`, typedef'ed as `arrowbar`. Moreover, when this arrowbar is called, it automatically draws not only itself, but also the path is was attached to. This makes it impossible to attach an arrowbar to a path and then mutate the path --- the arrowbar will remember the path's original state. Hence, `smoothmanifold` implements custom arrow/bar implementations:
#block(breakable: false)[
  #show: it => columns(2, gutter: 0pt, it)
  ```
  struct tarrow {
      arrowhead head;
      real size;
      real angle;
      filltype ftype;
      bool begin;
      bool end;
      bool arc;
  }
  ``` <def-tarrow>
  #colbreak()
  ```
  struct tbar {
      real size;
      bool begin;
      bool end;
  }
  ``` <def-tbar>
]

These structs store information about the arrow/bar, and are converted to regular arrowbars when the corresponding path is drawn to the picture. For creating new `tarrow`/`tbar` instances and converting them to arrowbars, the following functions are available:

#bl[
  #show: it => columns(2, gutter: 0pt, it)
  ```
  tarrow DeferredArrow(
      arrowhead head = DefaultHead,
      real size = 0,
      real angle = arrowangle,
      bool begin = false,
      bool end = true,
      bool arc = false,
      filltype filltype = null
  )
  arrowbar convertarrow(
      tarrow arrow,
      bool overridebegin = false,
      bool overrideend = false
  )
  ``` <def-tarrow-func>
  #colbreak()
  ```
  tbar DeferredBar(
      real size = 0,
      bool begin = false,
      bool end = false
  )
  arrowbar convertbar(
      tbar bar,
      bool overridebegin = false,
      bool overrideend = false
  )
  ``` <def-tbar-func>
]
The `overridebegin` and `overrideend` options let the user force disable the arrow/bar at the beginning/end of the path.

== The `fitpath` function <sc-def-fitpath>

This is a substitute for the plain `draw` function. The `fitpath` function implements steps 1-4 of the deferred drawing system describes above.

```
void fitpath (picture pic, path gs, bool overlap, int covermode, bool drawnow, Label L, pen p, tarrow arrow, tbar bar)
``` <def-fitpath>
Arguments:
- `pic` --- the picture to fit the path to;
- `gs` --- the path to fit;
- `overlap` --- whether to let the path overlap the previously fit paths. A value of `false` will lead to gaps being left in all paths that `gs` intersects;
- `covermode` --- if the path `gs` is cyclic, this option lets you decide what happens to the parts of previously fit paths that fall "inside" of `gs`. Suppose a portion `s` of another path falls inside the cyclic path `gs`. Then
  - `covermode == 2`: The portion `s` will be erased completely;
  - `covermode == 1`: The portion `s` will be "demoted to the background" --- either temporarily removed or drawn with dashes;
  - `covermode == 0`: The portion `s` will be drawn like the rest of the path;
  - `covermode == -1`: If the portion `s` is "demoted", it will be brought "back to the surface", i.e. drawn with solid pen. Otherwise, it will be draw as-is.
  Consider the following example:
  #example(
    image("resources/fitpath-showcase.svg"),
    [
      ```
      import smoothmanifold;
      path l = (-1.2,-1.2) -- (1.2,1.2);
      path c1 = unitcircle;
      path c2 = scale(.7) * unitcircle;
      path c3 = scale(.4) * unitcircle;
      fitpath(l, red);
      fitpath(c1, blue, covermode = 1);
      fitpath(c2, blue, covermode = -1);
      fitpath(c3, blue, covermode = 0);
      ```
    ],
    [A showcase of the `fitpath` function]
  )
- `drawnow` --- whether to draw the path `gs` immediately to the picture. When `drawnow == true`, the path `gs` leaves gaps in other paths, but is immutable itself, i.e. later fit paths will not leave any gaps in it. When `drawnow == false`, the path `gs` is not immediately drawn, but rather saved to be mutated and finally drawn at shipout time;
- `L` --- the label to attach to `gs`. This label is drawn to `pic` immediately on call of `fitpath`, unlike `gs`;
- `p` --- the pen to draw `gs` with;
- `arrow` --- the arrow to attach to the path. Note that the type is `tarrow`, not `arrowbar`;
- `bar` --- the bar to attach to the path. Note that the type is `tbar`, not `arrowbar`.

Apart from different types of the `arrow`/`bar` arguments, the `fitpath` function is identical to `draw` in type signature, and they can be used interchangeably. Moreover, there are overloaded versions of `fitpath`, where parameters are given default values (one of these versions is used in the example above):
#bl[
  #show: it => columns(2, gutter: 0pt, it)
  ```
  void fitpath (
      picture pic = currentpicture,
      path g,
      bool overlap = config.drawing.overlap,
      int covermode = 0,
      Label L = "",
      pen p = currentpen,
      bool drawnow = config.drawing.drawnow,
      tarrow arrow = null,
      tbar bar = config.arrow.currentbar
  )
  ```<def-fitpath-spec>
  #colbreak()
  ```
  void fitpath (
      picture pic = currentpicture,
      path[] g,
      bool overlap = config.drawing.overlap,
      int covermode = 0,
      Label L = "",
      pen p = currentpen,
      bool drawnow = config.drawing.drawnow
  )
  ```<def-fitpath-array>
]

Here, `config` is the global configuration structure, see @sc-config. Furthermore, there are corresponding `fillfitpath` <fillfitpath> functions that serve the same purpose as `filldraw`.

== Other related routines <deferred-misc>

The functions `erase`, `add`, `save`, and `restore` are redefined to automatically handle deferred paths.

= Operations on paths <sc-path>

== Set operations on bounded regions <sc-path-set>

Module `smoothmanifold` defines a routine called `combination` which, given two _cyclic_ paths `p` and `q`, calculates a result path which encloses a region that is a combination of the regions `p` and `q`:

```
path[] combination (path p, path q, int mode, bool round, real roundcoeff)
``` <path-combination>

This function returns an array of paths because the combination of two bounded regions may be bounded by multiple paths. Rundown of the arguments:
- `p` and `q` --- cyclic paths bounding the regions to combine;
- `mode` --- an internal parameter which allows to specialize `combination` for different purposes;
- `round` and `roundcoeff` --- whether to round the sharp corners of the resulting bounding path(s).
  #example(
    image("resources/round-showcase.svg"),
    ```
    <...>
    filldraw(
        combination(p, q, 1, false, 0), // <- no rounding
        drawpen = linewidth(.7),
        fillpen = palegrey
    );
    <...>
    <...>
    filldraw(
        combination(p, q, 1, true, .04), // <- yes rounding
        drawpen = linewidth(.7),
        fillpen = palegrey
    );
    <...>
    ```,
    [A showcase of the `round` and `roundcoeff` parameters]
  )

Based on different values for the `mode` parameter, the module defines the following specializations:

#bl[
  #show: it => columns(2, gutter: 0pt, it)
  ```
  path[] difference (
    path p,
    path q,
    bool correct = true,

    real roundcoeff = config.paths.roundcoeff
  )
  ``` <path-set-difference>

  { return difference(p, q); }
  ``` <path-set-difference-operator>
]#vs

  ```
  path[] symmetric (
    path p,
    path q,
    bool correct = true,
    bool round = false,
    real roundcoeff = config.paths.roundcoeff
  )
  ``` <path-set-symmetric>

  { return intersection(p, q); }
  ``` <path-set-intersection-operator>

    path[] ps,
    bool correct = true,

  )
  ``` <path-set-intersection-array>
  #colbreak()

  path[] intersection (
    bool correct = true,

```
path reorient (path g, real time)

Connect an array of points with a path.

```
path wavypath (real[] nums, bool normaldir = true, bool adjust = false)
path wavypath (... real[] nums)
``` <path-wavypath> #vs
Generate a clockwise cyclic path around the point `(0,0)`, based on the `nums` parameter. If `normaldir` is set to `true`, additional restrictions are imposed on the path. If `adjust` is `true`, then the path is shifted and scaled such that its `center` @path-center is `(0,0)`, and its `radius` @path-radius is `1`. Consider the following example:
#example(
  image("resources/wavypath-showcase.svg"),
  ```
  real[] nums = {1,2,1,3,2,3,4};
  bool normaldir = true;

  draw(wavypath(nums, normaldir));

  for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
    <...> // draw numbers
  }

  dot((0,0));
  ```,

= Smooth objects <sc-smooth>

== Definition of the `smooth`, `hole`, `subset`, and `element` structures <sc-smooth-ho-su-el>

The `smoothmanifold` module's original purpose was to introduce a suitable abstraction to simplify drawing blobs on the plane. The `smooth` structure is, perhaps, the oldest part of `smoothmanifold`, that has persisted through countless updates and changes. In its current form, here is how it's defined:

#bl[
  #show: it => columns(2, gutter: 0pt, it)
  ```
  struct smooth {
      path contour;
      pair center;

      string label;
      pair labeldir;
      pair labelalign;

      hole[] holes;
      subset[] subsets;
      element[] elements;

      transform unitadjust;

      real[] hratios;
      real[] vratios;

      bool isderivative;

      smooth[] attached;

      void postdraw (dpar, smooth);

      static smooth[] cache;
  }
  ``` <smooth-smooth>
  #colbreak()
  ```
  struct hole {
      path contour;
      pair center;
      real[][] sections;
      int scnumber;
  }

  struct subset {
      path contour;
      pair center;
      string label;
      pair labeldir;
      pair labelalign;
      int layer;
      int[] subsets;
      bool isderivative;
      bool isonboundary;
  }

  struct element {
      pair pos;
      string label;
      pair labelalign;
  }
  ``` <smooth-ho-su-el>
]

Every `smooth` object has a:
- `contour` --- the clockwise cyclic path that serves as a boundary of the object;
- `center` --- the center of the object, usually inferred automatically with `center(contour)` @path-center;
- `label` --- a string label, e.g. `"$A$"` or `"$S$"`, that will be displayed when drawing the smooth object;
- `labeldir` and `labelalign` --- they determine where the label is to be drawn, namely at `intersection(contour, center, labeldir)` @path-intersection, with `labelalign` as `align`.
  #figure(
    image("resources/labeldir-showcase.svg"),
    caption: [A showcase of the `labeldir` and `labelalign` fields]
  )
- `holes` --- an array of `hole` structures, each of which has a:
  - `contour` --- the clockwise cyclic boundary of the hole;
  - `center` --- the center of the hole, typically calculated automatically by `center(contour)` @path-center;
  - `sections` --- a two-dimensional array that determines where to draw the cross sections seen on @tangent. For a detailed description, see @sc-smooth-modes-free;
  - `scnumber` --- the maximum amount of cross sections that the hole allows other holes to share with it. These are sections _between holes,_ not ones between a hole and the contour of the `smooth` object. For details, see @sc-smooth-modes-free;
- `subsets` --- an array of `subset` structures, each of which has a:
  - `contour` --- the clockwise cyclic boundary of the subset;
  - `center` --- the center of the subset, likewise usually determined by `center(contour)` @path-center;
  - `label`, `labeldir`, `labelalign` --- serve the same purpose as the respective fields of the `smooth` object;
  - `layer` --- an integer determining the "depth" of the subset. A toplevel subset will have `layer == 0`, its subsets will have `layer == 1`, their subsets will have `layer == 2`, etc. This way, a hierarchy of subsets is established. For details, see @sc-smooth-subset;
  - `subsets` --- an index `i` is an element of this array if and only if the subset `subsets[i]` (taken from the `subsets` field of the parent `smooth` object) is a subset of the current subset. For details, see @sc-smooth-subset;
  - `isderivative` --- a flag that marks all automatically created subsets (i.e. those that represent intersections of existing subsets). For details, see @sc-smooth-subset;
  - `isonboundary` --- a flag that marks if the current subset touches the boundary of another subset.
- `elements` --- an array of `element` structures, each of which has a:
  - `pos` --- the position of the element;
  - `label` --- the label attached to the element, e.g. `"$x$"` or `"$y_0$"`;
  - `labelalign` --- how to align the label when drawing the element;
- `unitadjust` --- a transform that converts from unit coordinates of the smooth object to the global user coordinates (see @sc-smooth-unit);
- `hratios` and `vratios` --- two arrays that determine where to draw cross sections in the `cartesian` mode. For details, see @sc-smooth-modes-cartesian;
- `isderivative` --- similarly to `subset`, this field marks those `smooth` objects which are obtained from preexisting objects through operations of intersection, union, etc.;
- `attached` --- this field allows to bind an array of smooth objects to the current one. Drawing the current object will trigger drawing all of its `attached` objects. For example, the tangent space seen on @tangent is `attached` to the main object;
- `postdraw` --- a callback to be executed _after the `smooth` object is drawn._ It takes as parameters a drawing configuration of type `dpar` (see @sc-config-drawing) and the current `smooth` object;
- `static cache` --- a global array of all `smooth` objects constructed so far. It is used mainly to search for smooth objects by label. See @sc-smooth-by-label.

== Construction <sc-smooth-init>

Each of the four structures is equipped with a sophisticated `void operator init` that will infer as much information as possible. To construct a `smooth`, `hole`, or `subset`, it is only necessary to pass a `contour`. All other fields can be set in the constructor, but they are optional. To construct an `element`, it is only necessary to pass a `pos`, the `label` and `labelalign` fields have default values.

== Query and mutation <sc-smooth-method>

Already constructed structures can be queried and modified in a plethora of ways. Most methods return `this` at the end of execution for convenience.

=== Methods of `smooth` objects

```
real xsize () { return xsize(this.contour); }
real ysize () { return ysize(this.contour); }
``` <smooth-size> #vs
Calculate the vertical and horizontal size of `this`.

```
bool inside (pair x)
``` <smooth-inside> #vs
Check if `x` lies inside the contour of `this`, but not inside any of its `holes`.

      bool drag = true
  )
  ``` <smooth-move> #vs

  ```
  smooth shift (explicit pair shift)

  smooth shift
  (real xshift, real yshift = 0)

  smooth scale (real scale)

  smooth rotate (real rotate)
  ``` <smooth-move-sssr>
] #vs
Scale `this` by `scale` (with center at `point`), rotate by `rotate` around `point`, and then shift by `shift`. If `readjust` is `true`, also recalculate the `unitadjust` field. If `drag` is `true`, also apply the `move` to all smooth objects `attached` to `this`. In the end return `this`. The `shift`, `scale` and `rotate` methods on the right are all specializations of the `move` method.

```
void xscale (real s)
``` <smooth-xscale> #vs
Scale `this` by `s` along the x-axis.

```
smooth dirscale (pair dir, real s)
``` <smooth-dirscale> #vs
Scale `this` by `s` in the direction `dir`. Return `this`.

```

``` <smooth-setcenter> #vs
Set the center of `this` if `index == -1`, and the center of `this.subsets[index]` otherwise. If `unit` is `true`, interpret `center` in the unit coordinates of `this` (i.e. apply `this.unitadjust` to `center`). For the definition of `config.system.dummypair`, see @sc-config-system.

```
smooth setlabel (
    int index = -1,
    string label = config.system.dummystring,
    pair dir = config.system.dummypair,
    pair align = config.system.dummypair
)
``` <smooth-setlabel> #vs
Set the `label`, `labeldir` and `labelalign` of `this` if `index == -1`, and set these fields of `this.subsets[index]` otherwise. For the definition of `config.system.dummystring`, see @sc-config-system.
